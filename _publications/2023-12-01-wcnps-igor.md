**Abstract:**
Kronecker coding is a multi-linear coding technique that offers high adaptability code rate modification and which works well with shorter block lengths, the being an attractive solution for ultra-reliable low-latency communication scenarios present in beyond fifth generation and in sixth generation. This paper presents a new decoding algorithm called multiple least-squares Kronecker factorization decoder, which efficiently exploits the structure of Kronecker code. The proposed algorithm was tested via Monte Carlo simulations, considering Rayleigh and additive white Gaussian noise channels in a single-input-single-output system. For the additive white Gaussian noise channel, the proposed algorithm got a better performance than a low density parity check coding scheme at the same code rate and offered an $$E_b/N_0$$ gain of nearly $$7$$ dB for a target bit error ratio (BER) of $$10^{âˆ’3}$$ . For the Rayleigh fading channel scenario, a BER of $$10^{-3}$$ is observed at $$16$$ dB of signal-to-noise ratio.
