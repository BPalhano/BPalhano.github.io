**Abstract**:
Power control has been used to deal with co-channel interference and energy efficiency in mobile communication systems. This work compares different power control schemes implemented in a cell-free (CF) system simulation. The approaches used are stepwise removal algorithm (SRA), fractional power control (FPC) and max power (MP). The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) values indicate advantages in the use of FPC instead of SRA despite its low energy expenditure and transmitted power values shows its advantages instead of MP because of a better use of power resource.
